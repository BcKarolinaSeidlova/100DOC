			<h2 class="title" id="me"> About me</h2>
			<p>Hello! My name is Karolina Seidlova and I come from the Czech republic. For my first name is a bit long for everyday use in written communication (and spoken as well) so I use a short form of my name that is <em>Kaja</em>. And I decided to put it in my logo because it's short and it's part of me.</p>

			<p>My way to web development was not straight and easy. Many people start their IT carrier almost at nursery school. However, my interests were different in the past. As a small girl I dreamt of becoming an astronaut discovering new worlds like in Star Trek series - that is why my favourite motto is "per aspera ad astra" what means in English "through difficulties to the stars". I still love star-gazing at nights and every unusual astronomical event is a great opportunity for me to learn something new about the space.</p>

			<h3 class="title"> What I do when I'm not coding? </h3>
			<p> Not only mysteries of the space are my hobby. I love reading, especially fantasy genre is my cup of tea. Right now, I'm discovering amazing world called "Discworld" and I'm really enjoying it! When talking about discovering I must mention my passion for genealogy - shortly looking for ancestor in old archives written in old writtings. The last but not least is my love for music - I am a big fan of Queen and Adam Lambert, but there are many more groups I like. </p>

			<h3 class="title"> How did I get to coding? </h3>
			<p>Firstly I have to return to my study experiences and expectations. Later I tended to be a chemist or a biologist and later I graduated from Tomas Bata University. I was fresh from crisis management and popuplation protection. Despite the fact that today's world is full of crisis there was no job for me. I was lucky and on the last November I was accepted for the first phase of the Udacity scholarship by Google and on the February 2018 I was accepted for the second phase. Yay! Now, I study hard to become a font-end web developer. Welcome to my first page that introduces me and my portfolio work! </p>
