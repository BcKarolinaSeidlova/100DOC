			<h2 class="title"> 100 Days of Code </h2>
			<p> I decided to join this challenge almost a month ago(9/4/2018). However, due to many events I missed many days so the best way is to begin once again. </p>
			<p> The new round of my 100 days of Code will start on Moday 7th May. I choose this day for two a bit irracional reasons. Firstly, I like number seven (it is considered to be a lucky number in the Czech Republic). Secondly, it's a Monday so it's a great idea to start with a new week.
			</p>
			<h3 class="title"> What will I do?</h3>
			<p> Surprisingly, I will code and learn to code. As a udacity scholar I will study things on Udacity and work on my projects. Then, as a part of javascript traing, I will try to solve at least one kata on codewars everyday and/or I will try to solve a few items at freeCodeCamp.
			</p>
			<p> Except from these study matters, I will build a website about history and historical sights of a place where I live. This work includes creating the content as well, so sometimes I will have be more writer than coder. So wish me a good luck and keep your fingers crossed for me.
			</p>
			<h3 class="title"> My Progress</h3>
			<p> I used twitter to share my (everyday) progress with others who decided to join this challenge. But sometimes I would need more space than tweets can offer. For this session, I will make both tweets and short entries here everyday. The entries may include some extra ideas or notes about my other work progress in writing or my reflections, thoughts, things that happen to me. Yeah, here on web it will be more like usual diary.
			</p>
			<p>I hope you will have fun same as me and you will be encouraged to your own projects! My first entry appears today, so it will be counted as a day zero.
